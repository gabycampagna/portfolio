                <h1>About me</h1>
                <h5>For the past 5 years...</h5>
                <p>I've spent the past 16 months working at Slashdot Media as a UI Developer. The <a href="http://www.slashdot.org" target="_blank">slashdot.org</a> site was originally built in 1997.   One of my ongoing tasks was updating the legacy code base with newer technologies such as Sass, jQuery libraries, semantic HTML5, SVG files and fonts. </p>
                <p>My agile team succeeded at producing a site that is more optimized. We implemented a fresher appearance and design without changing the flow that our user base had become so accustomed to throughout the years. Designing and implementing new interactive features such as videos and polls to engage our users were just two of the projects I was focusing on. We launched both sections within just a few work sprints.</p>
                <p>The site is monetized, so working around Ad Blocking plugins was the last project I was a involved with. We wrote a script that allowed us to detect when the Ad Block plug in was enable and injected our own ads that were hooked to an API endpoint on another server. </p>
                <p>Slashdot was recently sold and my agile team was not absorbed in the new purchase, so I am now free to find something new.</p>
                <p>Before Slashdot I spent 3 years at Cisco Systems as a Front end Web Designer/Developer building internal websites for Cisco employees. My first project was to design mock ups and build a site for the Telepresence sales team. My hiring manager oversaw this project. He gave me creative license when it came to both design and implementation. I worked with a backend PHP programmer and consulted him on what we could and could not do dynamically. That project took about 6 months to complete.</p>
                <p>Cisco Systems reorganizes teams on a regular basis. I was moved with my backend programmer to 5 teams while I spent my time there. Our work involved everything from maintaining a portal of the Cisco Employee Connection site, to working closely with Marketing and Collaboration teams to update landing pages related to Events and Product Launches. Product managers sent all content via their Marketing Managers. We implemented all changes as quickly as requests came in. </p>
                <p>We also worked with Business Operations to build Dashboards. This was a great experience as I was able to work with Cisco Engineers. They would allow me the privilege of leading these small projects. I also had an opportunity to flex my banner design and graphic production muscles while I was at Cisco. I enjoyed my time there and would be happy to work there again one day. </p>
                <h5>The present</h5>
                <p>I am extremely passionate about web development and would like to find a fun, energetic, and exciting team to work with. I have a variety of skills to bring to any team, but I am also looking for an opportunity to work with newer technologies.</p>
                <p>Currently working on improving my Object-oriented Javascript skills along with Angular.js and React.js frameworks. </p>
                <h5>The far off past</h5>
                <p>I started in tech as a receptionist at Autodesk over ten years ago and worked my way into the tech field. Jumping through hoops at various tech companies as a data entry clerk, admin assistant, marketing assistant and coordinator, then website and ad design.</p>
